    </p>

    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
      we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible 
      (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
      then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any 
      further processing until deletion is possible.

      security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission

      11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
    </h4>

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
      browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing
      and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
      or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard 
      for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice 
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
